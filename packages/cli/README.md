Common Webpack settings for cli apps.

## Installation

```shell
npm install ctrine-webpack-settings-cli
```

## Usage

The settings can be used directly in your `webpack.config.js` like so:

```Javascript
module.exports = require('ctrine-webpack-settings-cli').default
```

## Expected directory structure

```

src
  main.js
webpack.config.js
```
* **build:** Directory where the compiled files will reside.
* **src:** Projectâ€™s source.
* **main.js:** Entry point.
* **webpack.config.js:** Actual Webpack config, the location of this file is
  used do determine the location of the `build` and `src` directories.
